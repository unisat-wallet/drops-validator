  "description": "NEON BTC: A voltage surge on the Bitcoin blockchain. A chaotic symphony of light and darkness, where digital art isnâ€™t just createdâ€”itâ€™s pulled from the abyss, electrified, and burned into the chain forever.\n\nThis isnâ€™t another project. This is a disturbance. A ripple in the ordinary. A rebellion against the mundane. We donâ€™t follow trends. We bend them, twist them, shatter themâ€”then rebuild with pure, unfiltered neon intensity.\nWe craft in flickering mentalityâ€”because only in the dark does neon shine brightest. Every inscription is a beacon, a pulse, a testament to scarcity and permanence. Bitcoin is the bedrock. We are the glow that refuses to die.\nðŸ”¹ Bitcoin is immutable. We make it electric.\nðŸ”¹ No noise. No fluff. Just raw, unapologetic ordinals.\nðŸ”¹ Rarity isnâ€™t assignedâ€”itâ€™s earned in the fire.\nThis is not for the passive. This is not for the faint. This is for those who move in neon-lit shadows, those who see beyond the surface, those who crave something bold. Electric. Unapologetic.\nWelcome to Neon BTC. Step into the current or fade into nothing.\n\nTotal Supply: 2000\nMint Price: TBA\nMint Date: TBA\n\nMint phases \n1. GTD\n2. Public\n",
